# Managing Delegations Using the Flare Portal

When you make delegations to data providers, you increase their vote power, reinforce the stability of the FTSO ecosystem, and earn monetary rewards.

This information explains how to manage your delegations using the [Flare Portal](https://portal.flare.network). Alternatively, if you have used block explorers for other networks and are competent interacting with smart contracts without a user interface, you can use the block explorer, which provides more options but can be more complex. Using it is intended for advanced users.

## Prerequisites

Before you delegate your vote power, you must:

* [Wrap your native tokens](../wrapping-tokens.md). Wrapped tokens are required to delegate your vote power to data providers.
* Choose 1 or 2 data providers. Multiple lists of data providers are available online, such as [FlareMetrics](https://flaremetrics.io/). As you browse the lists, consider the [factors that affect the potential for rewards](../../tech/ftso/index.md#rewards).
* [Understand how the timing of delegations affects rewards](../../tech/ftso/index.md#effects-of-the-vote-power-block-snapshot-on-delegations), and consider the following implications about the vote-power snapshot that will affect your rewards.

### Delegating Your Vote Power

1. Open the [Flare Portal](https://portal.flare.network). The home page is displayed.
