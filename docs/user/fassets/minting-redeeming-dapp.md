# Using the FAssets Demo Dapp to Mint and Redeem FAssets

Users of the [FAssets](../../tech//fassets/index.md) system can use the FAssets Demo Dapp with their [Bifrost wallet](https://bifrostwallet.com/?utm_source=flare_network&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=fasset_open_beta) to mint and redeem FAssets, which allow tokens on blockchains that do not support smart contracts to be used trustlessly with smart contracts on the Flare blockchain.
Alternatively, you can [use the command line to mint and redeem FAssets](./minting-redeeming-cli.md).

In this guide you will deposit some test XRP tokens into an XRP account and use the FAssets system to mint them into FTestXRP FAsset tokens on the Coston network.
You will receive these tokens in a Coston account.

!!! info "Open Beta"

    The FAssets system is currently in the [Open Beta](../../tech/fassets/open-beta.md) period.
    During this phase, user-friendly tools are still being developed.

3. Click **Enable** to activate **Developer Mode**.

## 2. Get Your Addresses for Testnet Tokens

To mint FAssets on the Coston network, you will need testnet tokens.
Before you can use faucets to get the tokens, you must get from Bifrost the addresses of the accounts on the XRP and Coston networks that you will use later in this guide.

1. Return to the **Settings** menu, click the upward arrow button, and then click **Receive**.

    <figure markdown>
    ![Receive Token](dapp-receive.png){ loading=lazy .allow-zoom }
    <figcaption>Choose to Receive a Token.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    </figure>

## 3. Get Testnet Tokens

You will need the addresses you copied in the previous step to get the testnet tokens.
Testnet tokens are free and have no monetary value.

1. On your computer, open the [FAssets Demo Dapp](https://fasset-beta-minting.flarelabs.org/).
2. On the home page, click **Get Your textXRP here**.
   The **XRPL Testnet Faucet** page is displayed.
3. Copy the XRPL address that you saved in Step 3 above, and paste it in the **XRPL address** field on the faucet page.
The XRP address is the address that does not start with `0x`.
4. In the **XRP (Testnet)** field, select 1000 XRP.
5. Select the checkbox.
6. Click **Send me XRP**.
   TestXRP tokens are sent to your Bifrost Wallet.

    <figcaption>Official Flare Faucet page.</figcaption>
    </figure>

8. Copy the CFLR address that you saved in Step 3 above, and paste it in the **Flare address** field on the faucet page.
The Coston address is the address that starts with `0x`.
9. Click **Request CFLR**.
   100 CFLR are sent to your Bifrost Wallet.

10. In your Bifrost Wallet, review your updated balances of testXRP and CFLR.

    Your camera application is activated.

3. In your camera application, align the QR code displayed in Step 1 until the application detects it.
   Bifrost Wallet prompts you to connect.

    <figure markdown>
    ![Confirm Connection](dapp-bifrost-confirm.png){ loading=lazy .allow-zoom }
    <figcaption>Confirm Connection.</figcaption>
    </figure>

4. Click **Connect**.
   The dapp is connected to your Bifrost Wallet.
   A confirmation dialog is displayed, and the FAssets Demo Dapp shows the balances of the two accounts.

## 5. Mint FTestXRP

1. In the FAssets Demo Dapp, locate the **FAssets** section on the page, and click **Mint** beside **FTestXRP**.

    <figure markdown>
    ![Mint FTestXRP](dapp-ftestxrp-mint.png){ loading=lazy .allow-zoom }
    <figcaption>Mint FTestXRP.</figcaption>
    </figure>

2. In the [Lots](../../tech/fassets/minting.md#lots) field, specify how many lots of FTestXRP you want to mint.
   To help the FAssets system, split the total into multiple transactions made over several days.

    <figure markdown>
    ![Lots](dapp-ftestxrp-lots.png){ loading=lazy .allow-zoom }
    <figcaption>Lots.</figcaption>
    </figure>

3. Click **Next**.
   The minting process begins.
   In Bifrost Wallet, a confirmation prompt for the collateral reservation is displayed, which shows the number of lots you specified and the minting fee.

    <figure markdown>
    ![Confirmation](dapp-ftestxrp-reserve.png){ loading=lazy .allow-zoom }
    <figcaption>Confirm the Collateral Reservation.</figcaption>
    </figure>

4. Click **Confirm** and input either your PIN or your biometrics, depending on the way you set up your wallet.
   The collateral is reserved, the CFLR is sent to the `FAssets` contract, and another confirmation prompt is displayed ([Step 2 of this process](https://docs.flare.network/tech/fassets/minting/#minting-process)).

    <figure markdown>
    ![Confirmation](dapp-ftestxrp-confirm.png){ loading=lazy .allow-zoom }
    <figcaption>Approve the Transaction.</figcaption>
    </figure>

5. Click **Confirm** and input either your PIN or your biometrics, depending on the way you set up your wallet.
   The transaction is approved.
   The [Data Connector](../../tech/state-connector.md) trustlessly proves that you, via the FAssets Demo Dapp, sent the right amount of testXRP to the correct address with the correct reference.
   This process for the Data Connector to come to consensus and provide the FAssets system with a proof that this has occurred takes approximately 5 minutes.
   Progress through the four stages of processing the mint is displayed.

    ![Mint Progress](dapp-ftestxrp-progress.png){ loading=lazy .allow-zoom }
    <figcaption>Example of a Mint Progress Window.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    After the proof is received, the FTestXRP is minted, and the balance is displayed in your Bifrost Wallet.

    <figure markdown>
    ![Mint Progress](dapp-ftestxrp-balance.png){ loading=lazy .allow-zoom }
    <figcaption>Example of a Mint Progress Window.</figcaption>
    </figure>

## 5. Redeem FTestXRP

You can follow a similar process to redeem your FTestXRP and receive your original testXRP back in your wallet.
During this open beta phase, if you run out of testXRP or Coston Flare, you can always head back to the faucets to get more.
Each address can obtain a maximum of 1000 testXRP and 100 CFLR per day.

FTestXRP is a regular [ERC-20](../../tech/glossary.md#erc20) token on the Coston network, so you can send it or receive it using standard tools, and the receiver can use the redeeming process described here to get the testXRP back.

!!! warning

    Remember to keep a small amount of CFLR for gas.
