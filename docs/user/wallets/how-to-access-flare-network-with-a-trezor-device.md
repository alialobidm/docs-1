## Wrap and Delegate

Once connected to a Flare network, enter the address of the website or dapp you wish to use to wrap and delegate in the MetaMask browser.
A few [FTSO](glossary.md#ftso) data providers have developed dApps integrated with their websites that allow users to wrap, delegate and claim SGB and Flare rewards.
Delegating using this method is not exclusive to one specific provider, as these dapps allow you to choose from a number of different providers.

Other providers have their own websites and are developing similar dapps.
See the full list of active data providers on [flaremetrics.io](https://flaremetrics.io).
