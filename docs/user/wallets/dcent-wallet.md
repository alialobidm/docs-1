# D'CENT Wallet

D'CENT Biometric Wallet is a **noncustodial hardware wallet** and is considered one of the most secure ways to manage your crypto assets.

## Getting Started

Purchase a D'CENT Biometric hardware wallet from the [official D'CENT shop](https://dcentwallet.com/Shop) or download their software wallet/mobile app from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dcent-wallet/id1447206611) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kr.iotrust.dcent.wallet).
Then either initialize a new wallet or import an existing one from a recovery phrase.

The official D'CENT device setup help guides can be found here: [https://userguide.dcentwallet.com/biometric-wallet/setting-up](https://userguide.dcentwallet.com/biometric-wallet/setting-up).

## Adding Flare Tokens

After your device is set up and synced with the mobile app, complete the following procedure to add native tokens `$FLR` and `$SGB` to your listed assets. Although this procedure also explains how to add the wrapped tokens `$WFLR` and `$WSGB` to your listed assets, you can automatically [add `$WFLR` and `$WSGB` using the Flare Portal](../wrapping-tokens.md#automatically).

1. Ensure the D'CENT biometric wallet is updated with the latest firmware, v2.24.0 or later.
2. Login to your D'CENT mobile app and have your device turned on, unlocked, and paired via Bluetooth.
3. Click the **+** sign on the bottom right of the **Account** tab.
4. In the **Search** box, search for one of the following tokens to add, and select the result:

     | Token                | Result                  |
     | ---------------------| ----------------------- |
     | `Flare`              | Flare (FLR)             |
     | `Songbird`           | Songbird Token (SGB)    |
     | `Wrapped Flare`      | Wrapped Flare (WFLR)    |
     | `Wrapped Songbird`   | Wrapped Songbird (WSGB) |

5. Name your new account, and click **Create**.
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for each token you want to add to the list of assets in your wallet.

## Wrap and Delegate

When you delegate your vote power to FTSO data providers, you not only support the Flare ecosystem but also earn monetary rewards.

You can wrap and delegate your `$SGB` using D'CENT's native FTSO Portal:

!!! note "Delegation instructions for the Flare network are awaiting confirmation."

1. Click the **Discovery** tab at the bottom middle of the screen.
2. Select the **FTSO Portal** from the menu then click **Go**.
3. Choose the Songbird account you wish to use and click **Connect**.
4. You will need to wrap your `$SGB` by clicking **SGB ↔️ WSGB** marked in green near the top middle of the screen.
5. Input the `$SGB` amount you want to wrap and click the green **SGB ↔️ WSGB** box.
6. Click **Confirm** and follow the prompts to sign the transaction with your hardware device.
7. You can now delegate your `$WSGB` by clicking **Add delegation**.
8. Select a provider and input the percentage of your `$WSGB` holdings you want to delegate to their service and press **Delegate**.

    !!! note

        Providers listed as a _Partner_ have additional security features integrated with D'cent.

9. Click **Confirm** and follow the prompts to sign the transaction with your hardware device.
10. To add a second provider (up to two), repeat steps 7 through 9.
