    * [Network Configuration](./reference/network-config.md)

All Flare networks are a fork of the Avalanche project, which runs the [Ethereum Virtual Machine](glossary.md#evm).
Therefore, all Ethereum contracts and tools work on Flare, Songbird and Coston.

All Flare networks are layer-1 networks, and run independently of both Avalanche and Ethereum.

You can interact with the Flare networks using [wallets](../user/wallets/index.md), block explorers, and the most common blockchain development environments.

## Open-Source Repositories

These are Flare's main source repositories, both on [GitHub](https://github.com/flare-foundation) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/flarenetwork).
